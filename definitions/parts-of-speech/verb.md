# VERB

## Definition

"A **verb**, from the Latin verbum meaning word, is a [word](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Word) \([part of speech](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Part_of_speech)\) that in [syntax](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syntax) conveys an action \(bring, read, walk, run, learn\), an occurrence \(happen, become\), or a state of being \(be, exist, stand\). In the usual description of [English](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_language), the basic form, with or without the [particle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grammatical_particle) to, is the [infinitive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infinitive). In many [languages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Language), verbs are [inflected](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflection)\(modified in form\) to encode [tense](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grammatical_tense), [aspect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grammatical_aspect), [mood](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grammatical_mood), and [voice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voice_%28grammar%29). A verb may also agree with the [person](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grammatical_person), [gender](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grammatical_gender) or [number](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grammatical_number) of some of its [arguments](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argument_%28linguistics%29), such as its [subject](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subject_%28grammar%29), or [object](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object_%28grammar%29). Verbs have tenses: present, to indicate that an action is being carried out; past, to indicate that an action has been done; future, to indicate that an action will be done." - [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Verb)
