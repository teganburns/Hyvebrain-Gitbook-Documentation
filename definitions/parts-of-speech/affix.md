# AFFIX

## Definition

"In [linguistics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linguistics), an **affix** is a [morpheme](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morpheme) that is attached to a word [stem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stem_%28linguistics%29) to form a new word or word form. Affixes may be [derivational](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morphological_derivation), like English -ness and pre-, or [inflectional](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflection), like English plural -s and past tense -ed. They are [bound morphemes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bound_morpheme) by definition; [prefixes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prefix) and [suffixes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suffix) may be [separable affixes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Separable_affix). Affixation is the linguistic process that speakers use to form different words by adding morphemes at the beginning \(prefixation\), the middle \(infixation\) or the end \(suffixation\) of words." - [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affix)
