# PRON

## Definition

"In [linguistics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linguistics) and [grammar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grammar), a **pronoun** \([abbreviated](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_glossing_abbreviations) **pro**\) is a word that substitutes for a [noun](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noun) or [noun phrase](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noun_phrase). It is a particular case of a [pro-form](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pro-form).

Pronouns have traditionally been regarded as one of the [parts of speech](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Part_of_speech), but some modern theorists would not consider them to form a single class, in view of the variety of functions they perform. Subtypes include [personal pronouns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_pronoun), [reflexive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reflexive_pronoun) and [reciprocal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reciprocal_pronoun) pronouns, [possessive pronouns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Possessive_pronoun), [demonstrative pronouns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demonstrative_pronoun), [relative pronouns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relative_pronoun), [interrogative pronouns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interrogative_pronoun), and [indefinite pronouns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indefinite_pronoun).[\[1\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pronoun#cite_note-Bhat-1):1â€“34[\[2\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pronoun#cite_note-Borjars-2)

The use of pronouns often involves [anaphora](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anaphora_%28linguistics%29), where the meaning of the pronoun is dependent on an [antecedent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antecedent_%28grammar%29). This applies especially to third-person personal pronouns and relative pronouns. For example, in the sentence That poor man looks as if he needs a new coat, the antecedent of the pronoun he is the noun phrase that poor man.

The [adjective](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adjective) associated with pronoun is **pronominal**.[\[A\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pronoun#cite_note-3) A pronominal is also a word or phrase that acts as a pronoun. For example, in That's not the one I wanted, the phrase the one \(containing the [prop-word](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prop-word) one\) is a pronominal.[\[3\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pronoun#cite_note-4)" - [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pronoun)
