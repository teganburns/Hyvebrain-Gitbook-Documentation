# Foreword

Before you begin to use **Hyvebrain** it's important to define the purpose of this API. Let's take a step back and look at technology as a whole...

Your **intellectual value** can roughly be summed up to three parts; **processing** _information_, **accessing** _information_, **retaining** _information_. In general we all have the same capacity to perform these functions. Therefore, you are considered smart, or valuable, if you're able to perform these functions __more effectively than others.

The ability to leverage technology allows you to perform these functions more effectively than others. Therefore the method in which you leverage technology has a direct impact on your **intellectual value**.

**Hyvebrain can be used to reduce the entropy \(disorder\) of accessing information \(knowledge/memories\) retained by technology.**

If I had asked you to tell me what you just read you'd most likely respond with a summary of what was stated above. We hardly ever **retain** _information_ exactly how it was presented to us. Hyvebrain takes advantage of this more efficient way of **processing**, **accessing**, and **retaining** _information_ that comes natural to us humans. 

The ability to leverage Hyvebrain allows you to **access** _information_ by requesting information in this more efficient method.
